<h1>Blog</h1>
<p>Welcome to my "blog"! I put it in quotes because this isn't very personal (I'm not biensoul),
partially becuase I can't be bothered, and because I probably don't know you. If your here for
personal information, and you can't ask me, chances are you probably shouldn't know. If you can tell
me who Orange is, though, I'll tell you whatever you want to know.</p>
<p>My writing here is pretty casual; slang, attempts at jokes, etc... I think doing otherwise would
be counter productive, especially here.</p>
