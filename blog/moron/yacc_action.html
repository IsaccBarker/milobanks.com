<h1>Mild confusion about yacc actions</h1>

<p>I'll admit, this problem stemmed from my own stupidity. What was the problem then? First, if you
don't know what Yacc is, let's have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">Wikipedia</a>
explain things:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) is a computer program for the Unix operating system developed
by Stephen C. Johnson. It is a Look Ahead Left-to-Right Rightmost Derivation (LALR) parser
generator, generating a LALR parser (the part of a compiler that tries to make syntactic sense of
the source code) based on a formal grammar, written in a notation similar to Backusâ€“Naur Form (BNF).
Yacc is supplied as a standard utility on BSD and AT&T Unix. GNU-based Linux distributions iinclude
Bison, a forward-compatible Yacc replacement.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In short, it's a program that takes in a specification of a language grammar (with some C code
mixed in), and spits out a C parser (more specifically, a <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR_parser">LALR parser</a>). If you want to learn more, you can
find my yacc tutorial <a href="/todo.html">here</a>. The below assumes some knowledge, so if you
don't know yacc you might want to take a peek.</p>

<p>Take the below yacc code (the <code>block</code> rule is only one that matters here):</p>

<pre><code>
...
%%
block: '{' '}'
     | '{' block_item_list '}'
     {
	if ($2 == '}') {
		// &lt;malloc enough space for some block_items&gt;
		goto end;
	}

	// &lt;realloc some more memory if we don't have enough memory to store another block_item&gt;

end:
}

block_item_list: block_item_list block_item
	       | block_item
	       ;

block_item: statement
          | expression
	  ;
%%
...
</code></pre>

<sub><b>Note: </b>the above code is a vast simplification.</sub>

<p>This was my first time writing a yacc parser, so naturally I jump right in after viewing a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__-wUHG2rfM">single YouTube video</a> without reading
the documentation.</p>

<p>You might be able to see what I did wrong, and if you did, you're already leagues head of
no-knowledge-of-yacc me. I was under the impression that one action is run per rule. In other words,
no matter if <code>'{' block_item_list '}'</code> or <code>'{' block_item '}' </code> matches, the
same action will be run.</p>

<p>This misconception of mine is what lead me to try and detect which pattern was matched by
checking if the second component of the rule is a '}'. If it was, we found an empty block, but if
not, the block contains some code.</p>

<p>Inevitably, this led to <code>block_items</code> never getting allocated, and also meant that the
parser crashed on empty blocks (not because there was no action, but because other actions that use
<code>block</code> as a component will dereference a null pointer).</p>

<p>I think the reason that I thought there was one action per rule (not per pattern), was because
I figured the developers back in the old-school UNIX days would be too lazy or resource contrained
to implement seperate actions for different patterns.</p>

<p>The lesson here is to read the documentation, and not assume developers from the 1970s are lazy.
