<p><i>Two for the price of one! Doubles as my motivation for building my own language.</i></p>

<article>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I used to switch programming languages a lot. I started with Lua (well, technically Bash, but
only on a very limited scale), moved to Python for a couple months, stewed in the world of Go<sup>
<a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> for a while, jumped to C++, then C, all the while dabbling in
other things like PHP or Perl because I needed to do something most easily accomplished in those
languages.</p>

<p>I stayed in the C and C++ ecosystem for a while, neither incredibly content nor wanting to
torture Bjarne Stroustrup or Dennis Ritchie. It was this limbo I was in, of being subtly frustrated
but not enough to do anything, that stalled both my programming abilities and knowledge of systems.
In the end, a combination of peer pressure from the internet and boredom encouraged me to try and
learn Rust.</p>

<p>Rust seemed like a great leap forward from the world of C and C++ at the time (for me, at least).
An approach to memory safety that seemed to actually work, a package (crate) system, better error
handling. However, after about two years, I grew more dissatisfied with the language. There were
some things that I <i>knew</i> to be safe, and would provide faster execution and clearer code, but
Rust disallowed them. On the surface, this is fine, so long as there is a way to "bypass" safety
checks, but this seems pointlessly hard in Rust. <b>Let me do things that seem stupid! I'm smarter
than you, compiler!</b><sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>There are also some other qualms I have with the language, such as it being less safe than
advertised and the community being very evangelicalistic, almost to the point of lying. Still, this
article is not about Rust, nor any other specific language, really, but rather about why I think I'm
qualified to dare to make a programming language and not make a mess of things.</p>

<h2>Why I (probably) won't make a mess of things</h2>
<p>Lets get one thing straight; I know almost nothing about compiler design. I'm going into this
basically blind, with the exception of a couple hours of research and reading chapters from <i>The
Dragon Book</i> (actually named Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools 2nd Edition, but the
colloquial name is more common), Advanced Programming Language Design. However, this ignores my
"not-exclusively-language-focused" experience.</p>

<p>I've been programming for years and years, most of them spent immersed in a system or kernel
context. If you asked me how a Javascript prototype differs from a C function prototype, I wouldn't
know, and would probably start spouting off bullshit. I've spent my time making kernel modules,
writting assembly for performance, reading language specifications (for their ABI) before this point,
and I feel I've learned enough from this stuff for it to serve as a decent jumping off point into
the pool of language design and compiler construction.</p>

<p>That's not to say I'm stupid enough to think it'll all go smoothly, or that I know everything I
need to know. There are still plenty of things I don't know, and that's partially why I'm
undertaking this (learning!).</p>

In the next part you'll join me on designing my language.

I'm unsure what this is, and while it isn't unpleasant, it's still very strange. I have not felt
this feeling, or a feeling like it, when programming in a language that isn't Go.</p>
